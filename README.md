# web-scraping-challenge

This repo contains two jupyter notebooks, demonstrating web scraping proficiency with Splinter and parsing with Beautiful Soup.   

The first notebook contains code to scrape titles and preview text from news articles and output to a json file. 

The second notebook contains code to scrape table data from a web page and analyse it using pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, resulting in several plots and a CSV export.
